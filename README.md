### Features

#### Prime Number's Fountain

Generating safe primes can take a lot of computing time. 
To overcome this problem, we have imagined storing our safe primes in an accessible and editable location.
We decided to call this thing: ** The Prime Number's Fountain **

With this method, the user can have safe prime numbers loaded in his free time and use them appropriately at the right time.
